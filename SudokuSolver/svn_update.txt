[15/03/2017, 10:31:06 a.m.] Alla Münch: Hi, I still can't svn up Integration branch, I get
svn: E175009: XML parsing failed: (413 Request Entity Too Large) for NVCCP
and svn: E020014: Error retrieving REPORT (20014): Internal error for VL models
How have the others solved it?

[15/03/2017, 10:39:27 a.m.] Hector Llorens: or do you have all langs checkedout in svn?

[15/03/2017, 10:50:18 a.m.] Alla Münch: Hector, no, how should I use svn exclude?
[15/03/2017, 11:01:26 a.m.] Hector Llorens: it is in the "workflow" page
